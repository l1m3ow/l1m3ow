<div align="center"> <b>Hi ✌ I'm Ilya!</b> </div>

**About me:**

I am a first-year student at RTU MIREA. I am studying at the IPTIP (Institute of Advanced Technologies and Industrial Programming). I have enrolled in the full-stack development specialty. 

**Plans:**

Write two tutorials for the first year of study. The first tutorial will cover the basics of algorithms, based on the curriculum and the book "Grok Algorithms". The second tutorial will cover the basics of the Go Lang programming language.

**Gratitude:**

Thank you all for taking the time to read and study the materials. And for following me on my journey of plan implementation.
